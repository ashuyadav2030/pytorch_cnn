# Custom CNN from Scratch with Optuna Hyperparameter Tuning (PyTorch)

This project implements a Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CCNN) from scratch using PyTorch, integrated with Optuna for hyperparameter tuning. It supports training on standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10) or your own.

# Features
Built from scratch using torch.nn modules

Customizable architecture: conv layers, batch norm, dropout, etc.

Fully integrated with Optuna for hyperparameter search

Clear training/validation pipeline

Real-time visualization of Optuna trials

Easily extensible to other datasets
